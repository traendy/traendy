### Hi there 👋

My name is Sönke, but i am totally fine if you call me Soenke or Sonke.

I am a software engineer focused on Android development. 

At the momemt I am working for eos.uptrade.de an innovative company from germany. We are improving the public transport experience with software and ingenuity every day.
Through this position I am contributor to nearly every mayor (and some minor) public transportation app in germany.

This GitHub profile contains my private projects I did for research and fun. Do not take them too serious.🤗

Check out a game I recently published https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.traendy.spaceshooter ✌️

Have an nice stay. 😁
